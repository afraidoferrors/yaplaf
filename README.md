A little software that compares texts with the longes common string algorithm that I wrote for a bachelor thesis in 2008.

It was used to compare short texts students had to write in TU Wien's E-Learning platform TUWEL.

There is an in-depth description available in the second part of the bachelor thesis available in the folder named "other".

It's checked in "as-is" as an eclipse project.

To test it check it out and run YAPLAF.Main.
